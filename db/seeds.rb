    title: "Gary Papers", 
    content: "<p>GRAY PAPERS</p><p>EDITOR'S LETTER BY ELAINE W. NG FROM JUL/AUG 2014</p><p>With July and August upon us, the editors at ArtAsiaPacific are moving in tandem with these wonderfully languid months. Making the most of this unhurried pace, this issue looks back at some of the important artistic figures and movements from Asia after World War II, a period that witnessed the emergence of alternative art practices as well as much of the visual language that we take for granted today.</p><p>Our cover story, “Beyond White: Reading Tansaekhwa Today” by Robert Liles, introduces a controversial movement associated with a loosely connected group of South Korean painters active in the late 1960s. Liles explores Tansaekhwa (“monochrome painting”) by revisiting one of the first overseas exhibitions of the group, entitled “Five Korean Artists, Five Kinds of White,” which took place in 1975 at the Tokyo Gallery in Japan. Liles discusses the work made by the participating artists and the debates surrounding the cultural significance of their distinct style in the aftermath of the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–45) and the Korean War (1950–53). </p><p>From London, Stephanie Bailey meets Pakistani-British artist Rasheed Araeen, a pioneering spirit who, in the 1960s, made some of the earliest Minimalist art and later penned stinging critiques of Western hegemony in the arts and social sciences in Europe. After pouring through scores of texts by and about Araeen, and conducting a long and candid conversation with the artist at his home, Bailey writes about his earliest sculptures: “Araeen was searching for a more free-form language that might express, as he perceived it, the spirit of the times—this was 1968, after all—and the hierarchical limits of composition he perceived within it: a break in formal structure that he described as a move from hierarchical to egalitarian.” </p><p>In a poignant reminder of the passage of time, Thai-Indian artist Navin Rawanchaikul wrote a letter that formed part of the group exhibition “Spiritual Ties,” a tribute celebration for Montien Boonma (1953–2000), on what would have been his 60th birthday. Dearest Montien (2013), which we reprint in full, describes the Thai art scene since the artist’s death more than a decade ago, and the impact Montien, as artist, teacher, mentor and friend, has had on the tight-knit art community, particularly his sociopolitical, and later spiritual, approach to art making, which combined local, everyday materials to explore topics ranging from Thailand’s industrialization to Buddhist notions of impermanence and mortality.   </p><p>Also looking back in time, Hong Kong artist Lam Tung-Pang created “What Is Disappearing” for our special feature column Inside Burger Collection. Sparked by his 2013 work Ghost – Disappeared Hong Kong Art (1): 90s, Kurt Chan, an ongoing project originally commissioned and produced by Burger Collection for their exhibition “I Think It Rains” (2013), here Lam expands the series, which explores Hong Kong works, particularly ephemeral installations from the 1990s, that endure only as faint recollections in the form of slides and catalog illustrations. </p><p>In our artist and collector profiles, we look at the careers of Australian collector and philanthropist Gene Sherman, and Indian photographer Anup Mathew Thomas. Guest contributor Taro Masushio meets peripatetic performative artist Ei Arakawa, fresh from his collaborative, interactive project Hawaiian Presence for the 2014 Whitney Biennial, and contributing editor Isabella E. Hughes speaks with Doha-based Iraqi artist Mahmoud Obaidi about his concept of home. </p><p>In Essays, associate editor Sylvia Tsai attends Sharjah Art Foundation’s annual March Meeting and considers the symposium’s agenda of how artists might build communities and social consciousness through their practice. Similarly, assistant editor Ming Lin heads to China to look at an off-beat project, “Social Sensibility,” at Bernard Controls, a French-owned hi-tech manufacturer. The project encourages artists, designers, musicians and other creatives to stage events on its Beijing premises, where “the medium is relationships.” Rounding out the section, managing editor John Jervis contemplates the evolution of Hong Kong’s art scene through Hanart TZ Gallery’s 30th anniversary exhibition, “Idiosyncrasies,” featuring 100 works from owner Chang Tsong-zung’s personal collection, which includes 1950s watercolor proposals for Beijing’s Monument to the People’s Heroes and video art from the past decade.  </p><p>For One on One, the hard-to-pin-down Hong Kong artist Lee Kit offers some notes about his obsession with a mysterious character named Johnny, who seems to be everywhere and nowhere in the artist’s dreams. For Where I Work, we head to Dubai to visit the convivial mash-up that comprises the home-studio of three artists, Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian. Dispatch takes us to Ho Chi Minh City, where our new desk editor, Ruben Luong, explains the art scene’s recurring cycles of optimism and disappointment—from socialist-market Doi Moi to more recent socioeconomic reforms—that compel the young and growing community of local, foreign and Viet kieu, or overseas Vietnamese, artists to confront and mine their pre- and postcolonial histories, and to create something sustainable for the future. And in Fine Print, art lawyer Sergio Muñoz Sarmiento playfully considers why artists destroy or damage artworks, and if their acts of vandalism might be interpreted as “art.” </p><p>Pausing, in the heat of summer, to reflect on art and artists from the recent past, and on notions of continuity and disruption, provides an opportunity for us to refresh and meditate before the onset of the next lively season, teeming with new projects and states of mind.</p>"

    title: "Dearest Montien: A tribute to Montien Boonma",
    content:"<p>DEAREST MONTIEN: A TRIBUTE TO MONTIEN BOONMA</p><p>FEATURES BY NAVIN RAWANCHAIKUL AND GRIDTHIYA GAWEEWONG FROM JUL/AUG 2014</p><p>THAILAND</p><p>Introduction: Why Montien Boonma now?</p><p>The late Montien Boonma (1953–2000) is one of Thailand’s best-known artists. Working through sculpture and installation to portray the country’s shift from its previous agrarian economy and culture toward industrialization, his practice brought a fresh perspective to modern Thai art. Montien’s sociopolitical, and later spiritual, approach combined local content with readymade materials to explore such different subject matters as Buddhist teachings and human experience. </p><p>With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a boom in globalization and multiculturalism resulted in Western curators turning to \"the periphery.\" 
    Acclaim for Montien’s early works led to his first solo exhibition outside Thailand, organized by the Japan Foundation and held at the ASEAN Cultural Center in Tokyo and Mitsubishi-Jisho Atrium, Fukuoka, in 1991. Soon Montien’s works were included in major international shows across the Asia-Pacific area and beyond, yet he was often unable to travel to these events after his wife, the artist Chancham Boonma, fell ill in the early 1990s, finally passing away in 1994. Five years after his own death in 2000, Montien was chosen to represent Thailand at the 51st Venice Biennale. </p><p>Montien was also an influential teacher and, although originally from Bangkok, was among the pioneers of Chiang Mai University’s Faculty of Fine Arts. His determination to communicate the shift from modernism to postmodernism in the Western art world inspired colleagues as well as students. Among the latter was Navin Rawanchaikul, a Thai-Indian artist who started at the Faculty in 1989. Although he did not study under Montien, Navin became his disciple and was later to assist him on several projects. </p><p>MONTIEN BOONMA (left) and NAVIN RAWANCHAIKUL (right) installing Lotus Sound, 1990, at the first Asia Pacific Triennial, Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane, 1993. Courtesy Navin Rawanchaikul. </p><p>In Chiang Mai, Navin helped Montien set up works to be photographed for his catalogs, while also driving and transporting the works. The two became close, and Montien introduced Navin to Alfred Pawlin, owner of Bangkok’s Visual Dhamma Gallery, who later organized the show “Social Contract: New Art from Chiang Mai” (1993) for Montien and his students. Montien was also a driving force behind the successful Chiang Mai Social Installation, a collective project by lecturers, students and artists in public spaces around the city in the early 1990s. This project helped Navin to launch his own career with his first public art project, The Journey (1992), for which he asked audiences to donate everyday objects. </p><p>As Montien’s assistant, Navin traveled to the Asia Pacific Triennial in Brisbane in 1993. In early 1994, with Montien’s wife increasingly unwell, Navin went alone to the Adelaide Festival. After her death a few months later, Montien moved back to Bangkok and continued to work hard, while Navin developed his traveling Taxi Gallery, which launched in 1995. The previous year, Navin had participated in the 4th Asian Art Show at the Fukuoka Art Museum in Japan; two years later he relocated to Fukuoka following his marriage to a Japanese curator. </p><p>Montien’s death in 2000 at the height of his career was a shock and a great loss to his friend and to the art community across Thailand, which recognized and honored Navin’s role as his protégé and the deep rapport between the two. After the initial rush of posthumous solo exhibitions in the United States and Asia, few shows were organized in Montien’s memory until the Jim Thompson Art Center, Bangkok, hosted an archival-based exhibition in 2013 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his birth. Navin wrote one letter to Montien for display in this show, and another for “Spiritual Ties,” an exhibition at Chulalongkorn University’s Art Center in Bangkok that same year, curated by Somporn Rodboon, which brought together Montien’s students from Chiang Mai to pay homage to their teacher. </p><p>Navin’s first letter relates how he won the Silpathorn Award from Thailand’s Ministry of Culture in 2010, saying that he would like to dedicate the award to Montien, while the second letter, Dearest Montien (2013), is reprinted here. In the letter, Navin asks Montien’s permission to make a pair of paintings and a video, having recently visited the home of Montien’s mother-in-law in Bangkok, where Montien’s wife stayed during her final days, and where his son now lives. </p><p>Filling Montien in on what has happened since his death, Navin’s letters describe the local contemporary art scene in its social, political and economic contexts over the last two decades and also pay homage to Montien and his will to collaborate with his beloved wife. The letters subtly illuminate Navin’s attitudes toward the role of the institution and that of cultural policies, which he critiques constructively, and reflect the love and gratitude of an artist and individual to his mentor, teacher and colleague. A rare gesture in the competitive art world, Navin’s sentiments bring home the spiritual aspect of Montien’s works and provide proof that Montien’s legacy still lives. </p><p>Gridthiya Gaweewong</p><p>MANIT SRIWANICHPOOM, Montien Boonma, 1995, gelatin silver print, 50.8 × 41 cm.

It has been almost three years since I last wrote to you. Today I would like to consult with you about a project that has something to do with your family. As always, I trust that you will once again guide me along the right path. </p><p>Yesterday I met Mr. Masahiro Ushiroshoji, the former Chief Curator at the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum. Do you remember him? He is one of my mentors and we were neighbors when I first settled in Japan almost 20 years ago. At that time my wife and I lived in a co-ophousing project called Murozumi Danchi: the type of community with lots of apartment buildings that represents the urbanization of Japanese society. I found that the place was filled with lots of elderly people living alone and, after years of wandering around, in early 1998 I came up with an idea for a video work that gives them a voice. The result was a public exhibition in front of a supermarket located in the center of the community. It was held at the beginning of spring so we celebrated the show with a picnic under some Sakura trees. At the picnic I remember those elderly collaborators sang a traditional song of spring about the beauty of blossom and its short life. A much-loved cultural icon in Japan, Sakura is a reminder of our humanity—our mortality. The flowers that bloom today are soon dead and falling, but there is still a beauty in the cycle. Recalling this reminds me of how you once said that you like the way the Japanese think the beauty of pottery lies in its fragility. With such awareness of impermanence, I can understand why you were satisfied when your towers of ceramic bells and bowls collapsed and smashed into pieces. </p><p>Over lunch with Ushiroshoji-san we talked about you a lot and he was happy to receive a copy of an old photo of you both. Taken at the opening of the “New Art from Southeast Asia” show in Japan back in 1992, I found it at the Jim Thompson Art Center. They had borrowed it from your house when preparing a commemorative exhibition on the occasion of your would-be 60th birthday. Put together by our dear friend Jeab and her team, it is a unique show featuring unseen sketches and archival materials recently found at your house. It is still on view and I am glad that I went to the opening-day symposium. Everyone who attended said it felt like your birthday party!</p><p>I was still a student but that year meant a lot to me. It was the time when I became your assistant and you kindly brought me and some of my fellow students to Bangkok for our debut show under the label of “New Art from Chiang Mai.” The first Chiang Mai Social Installation, in which we used temples and cemeteries as exhibition sites, was also launched. I vaguely remember joining my friends to install your work in a pond at Wat Umong temple—a set of terra-cotta alms bowls that sank into the water after a few days of floating. I know you often used alms bowls as metaphors for the mind, or what you used to call mind practice, but I did not discover their meaning until recently, when I got a chance to carry one myself during a spell as a monk. During this time I often thought about you and felt we were connected again.  </p><p>I would also like to share with you that I recently got a chance to visit your mother-in-law, whom I know you were close to. She is 88 now but still in good shape and as elegant as I remember her. She could not remember me at first, but when I told her my name she knew immediately who I was. We had a great time talking about the old days and found it funny that I still remember her home phone number. This is because back when you moved from Chiang Mai to Bangkok to look after your sick wife she was our main means of communication. As things turned out, I did not get a chance to meet her in person until shortly before you departed, but 13 years on I was glad to see her again. It brought memories flooding back. </p><p>Production still from NAVIN RAWANCHAIKUL’s House of Hope, 2013, showing Montien Boonma’s family photos.

Courtesy the artist. </p><p>My revisiting your house also led to a chance discovery. Before leaving, a friend who came along asked me to look at the wall above the piano in the living room. She said there is a blank canvas frame there. At first I thought it was part of the wall but, looking behind that partition, I could see a wood stretcher. Then, I was even more stunned to learn that this frame was prepared by you for your son Bank to use in the future. That evening I couldn’t stop thinking about that blank canvas and how it might be able to help me reconnect your great spirit with your family and the house you all lived in together. </p><p>A few days later I got a chance to meet Bank and asked him about it. While I respect that this empty canvas is for his use, I proposed to him that he let me share his legacy by creating a dialogue between your work and mine. As a father of a young child, I feel that it is somehow relevant to my own life. I am also reminded about my relationship with my own dad and would like to share my experiences with him. Bank has accepted my proposal but asked me to tell you about it, so let me explain further. </p><p>I plan to create a painting with the same dimensions as your frame but nothing will be removed from the original wall. The painting would portray your family all together through traces of memory and photographs found at your house. In it, Bank’s grandma would sit in front of the piano, surrounded on both sides by loved ones from past and present. Bank would appear twice, both as a little boy and as giant as he is now! I have already shown a sketch of it to them. They like that I have included the two family dogs, Coke and Cake, and have also suggested that I add Kib-kab, the late dog that you and your wife adopted from Silpakorn University. Bank is searching for a photo of Kib-kab for me, as well as other dogs that were part of your family. </p><p>I would also include Bank’s dinosaur toys and some souvenirs from your travels abroad that still decorate your house. Among these items there would also be a telescope that connects to the final stage of your life and work. Jeab told me that she took you out in a wheelchair to buy it for Bank as a birthday present. I was moved to learn that you hoped to use it with him to watch a lunar eclipse that was happening soon. That was less than a month before you departed, so we are wondering whether you got the chance to do it. It is a sad but beautiful tale that helps us to recall how thoughtful you were and how much you value family. In my painting of your family reunion, the lunar eclipse is seen against a starry sky, amid reflections of your question marks and exclamations. </p><p>I will name this work after one of your masterpieces, House of Hope, and I have told Bank that I would love to do another after finishing this one. The end result will be a pair of similar paintings. One would be given to your family, and the other I would display at my new studio in Chiang Mai. Speaking of which, there is a long drama about this dream studio that has landed me in a sea of depression. I pray that the reconciliation of the two paintings at both our houses of hope will help me to reevaluate things before I continue in whatever life path is best. </p><p>NAVIN RAWANCHAIKUL, House of Hope, 2013, video: 6 min. Collection of the Estate of Montien Boonma. Courtesy the artist.</p><p>Finally, to complete the project, I would like to request something from your late wife. At the exhibition at the Jim Thompson Art Center, I learned that one of your unrealized projects was an installation about your family that would accompany Chopin’s Funeral March. I was subsequently told that your wife used to play this tune on her piano and that you were very fond of it and even chose it for your funeral music. To pay homage to your love for each other, I would like to use this music to reconnect your family. We are still searching for the original “Piano Pieces for Children” scorebook that she used to play from but we have already found a lovely young girl who is willing to collaborate. Her name is Mimi. She was really inspired after I told her about you and why I would like to do this project. If you accept, she will come over to your place and perform the Funeral March on your wife’s piano. I know that this tune is a token of love, but I promise to do it with tenderness and respect. Bank and the rest of his family have accepted and his grandma has agreed to be filmed as well. </p><p>I hope you will grant me permission to realize this project. Please be with us for the shooting next Sunday and come to visit the exhibition at Chulalongkorn Art Center, where I will present this work among pieces by your former student-cum-assistants from Chiang Mai. The show is being put together by Ajarn Somporn, your beloved teacher. </p><p>I have told my wife all about this work and she would like to see the result. We are talking about going to Bangkok in mid-August during Japan’s Obon Festival, when people return to their hometowns and the spirits of ancestors are said to visit their homes. My daughter Mari has said she would prefer to go to her grandma’s place in Japan and join them in carving small horse and cow offerings out of cucumbers and eggplants. The Japanese believe the horses enable their ancestors to travel home quickly and the cows help them to return slowly. Let’s see if we can convince her to make those horses and cows in Bangkok traffic. Or maybe we should create a Taxi Gallery salad instead?</p><p>By the way, my wife has just reminded me to call Bank, as he phoned when I was out. I’m sure you’ll be proud to hear that, having followed his parents’ path, he graduated recently from your alma mater. He also seems to have his dad’s passion for Japanese culture, but a different side of it. Currently he is in Tokyo studying Japanese before fulfilling his dreams in anime world! Before I sign off, I would like to tell you that I recently visited the ruined pagoda near Chiang Mai city gate. I know that was the place where you found inspiration for the pagoda series you created when you lived in Chiang Mai, so in front of it I prayed for you and recalled how you believe in art and its power to engage with society and our roots. </p><p>Thank you so much. I hope that your great spirit continues to guide me. To this day, I always say I am a proud student of Montien Boonma. Without you, I would never have made it this far (or ever written this long a letter!).</p><p>We all miss you!</p><p>Humble Regards,</p><p>Yours, </p><p>Navin</p>"

    title: "Pacific Peripheries EI ARAKAWA", 
    content: "<p>PACIFIC PERIPHERIES</p><p>EI ARAKAWA</p><p>PROFILES BY TARO MASUSHIO FROM JUL/AUG 2014</p><p>It would be easy to mislabel Ei Arakawa as a “Japanese artist.” His work See Weeds (2011), for example, features performers who take iconic Gutai paintings mounted on wheeled frames and move them around in unison with music, making them “dance.” The accompanying narration consists of stories that the artist uncovered through archival research regarding the conflicts Gutai members had with artists of the previous generation. The piece demystifies the Gutai collective, reframing its potential for further discussion. As well as engaging with conversations in Japanese art history, See Weeds also poses questions about the ontology of painting itself by repositioning it—literally—as a moving object. </p><p>In his diverse, performative works, Arakawa employs tropes of ethnic and cultural identity, but in such a way that they are not confined to their own discourse. Arakawa himself has a transnational presence that confuses geography and national identity—and this is not just because his works or images are everywhere, including in the Georgia Pavilion at the 2013 Venice Biennale, as well as last year’s triennial survey of Japanese contemporary art, “Roppongi Crossing,” at the Mori Art Museum, Tokyo. He is constantly moving around the world, disseminating his presence by performing in numerous global locales, and further multiplying it via collaborative processes and the production of physical objects. This “everywhere-but-nowhere” condition informs his sensibility: performative, on-the-go and somewhat indeterminate. </p><p>His latest collaborative project, with New York-based artist Carissa Rodriguez for the 2014 Whitney Biennial, takes us far from the island of Manhattan to the Hawaiian archipelago. Hanging from custom-made racks, the installation Hawaiian Presence (2014) consists of three oversized, wearable hats in the shapes of Kauai, Hawaii (aka “the Big Island”) and Manhattan. Each is large enough to be worn by two or three people at a time. Additionally, there are two vitrines, one housing a clock and the other its case, and two paintings composed of volcanic salt, suggesting the texture of a Hawaiian beach. Here, the artists conceive of the archipelago as a location layered with geopolitical narratives and aesthetic confluences, and shaped by a range of ethnic and cultural transfigurations. Their work becomes a stage, and an uncanny theater begins to reverse the islands’ stereotyped image as a utopia. For certain periods of the exhibition, Arakawa sat on a stool in the gallery, clad in floral-printed Prada (from the 2014 “Menacing Paradise” collection), awaiting visitors to the site. Then, the iPhone, Galaxy, iPad or digital camera is raised. Oddly it seems as though there is always someone, whether visitors, Arakawa’s friends or museum workers, to capture the decisive moment—a souvenir from the fantastic, for private gratification or to be shared on social-networking sites.</p><p>When I ask about Hawaiian Presence, Arakawa responds with startling and unusual frankness: “Manhattan is a decoy.” He continues, “For most visitors to the exhibition, it’s easier to relate internally to the shape of Manhattan. It functions as another entry point to access the work.” Arakawa uses objects to entice and allure people into the work, almost mischievously tricking them into assuming an operational role. “I wanted the viewer’s experience to be of a dynamic nature rather than an inert one,” he says. The process begins when the museumgoer starts to gaze at Arakawa and his hats from a moderate distance—a safe-enough place to observe. But, just as Arakawa speaks about his collaborative and participatory works as a “mechanism for decentralizing attention,” in Hawaiian Presence he is quick to invite people into the work, shifting the dynamics. The responses vary from enthusiastic laughter to contrived smiles. For the most part, Arakawa maintains his composure. He doesn’t seem concerned about the audience’s comfort per se, but is more interested in the transformative sway that artworks may have on people. The ensuing awkwardness, the ambivalent reaction of the visitor, occurs in relation to the initial curiosity—and pleasure in watching—which does not get fully satisfied as the viewer turns into the viewed. What is usually an individual and private act is inverted, and becomes not only a shared experience but also an active spectacle. </p><p>Two years earlier, for a performance at the Tanks at London’s Tate Modern, Arakawa had orchestrated a scene in which singles gathered and boldly intermingled through the mediation of artworks, while Arakawa went around singing, clapping hands or just smiling and laughing awkwardly as the energy of the crowd shifted from one state to another. His roles in these events remain entirely fluid, moving from that of the emcee to a performer or a viewer. Arakawa not only embraces the uncertainty, confusion and insecurity of the audience (as well as his own) that often characterizes participatory actions, but he pushes them further. When entering into this field of cooperative action, we are left a little vulnerable. </p><p>Personal relations are frequently interwoven in Arakawa’s collaborative practice. In Helena and Miwako (2013), a project created with fellow artist Henning Bohl that was shown at the 2013 Carnegie International, Arakawa’s mother Miwako serves as one of the protagonists of the video. Exploring Arakawa’s hometown of Fukushima, the work reflects the climate of confusion, loss and melancholia that followed the earthquake-tsunami and radioactive leakages of March 2011, without explicitly referencing the events. In the piece, Helena—Bohl’s young daughter—travels from Germany to Japan in search of Nadeshiko, the Japanese national female football team. Shot largely in playgrounds built by Japanese architect Mitsuru Senda and exhibited alongside colorful soccer balls at the Carnegie International, the film has a playfulness that is in stark contrast with the invisible background of disjuncture and mourning. Helena intermittently asks Miwako and the camera, “Nadeshiko wa dokodesuka?” (“Where is Nadeshiko?”), but is answered only by more scenes of empty playgrounds.</p><p>As one observes in Helena and Miwako, Arakawa is not concerned with verisimilitude or consistency. Helena’s heavily accented and shaky Japanese embodies multiplicity, synthesizing a “German-ness” and a “Japanese-ness,” if there are such things. A similar effect occurs when Arakawa himself speaks. He speaks English in a somewhat familiar but oddly symphonic accent—where parentheses and ellipses are placed at unusual but rhythmical intervals. The artist emerges on the margin of identity, walking the line between art-historical narratives and ambiguous potentiality, between personal and public, between being Japanese and not, between American and not American. </p><p>While testing the symbolic weight of history, Arakawa stealthily changes familiar scenarios from outside in and inside out. His works are filled with elaborate, precise humor that encompasses highly nuanced subversion (the inclusion of Hawaii in New York, in the Whitney Biennial, for example), aptly confusing and displacing the central from the marginal. And this is precisely how Arakawa takes us to an uncertain and mesmerizing destination such as “Hawaii.”</p>"

    title: "Vital Encounters", 
    content: "<p>VITAL ENCOUNTERS</p><p>EDITOR'S LETTER BY ELAINE W. NG FROM SEP/OCT 2014</p><p>In East Asia, the September season arrives with a gauntlet of festivals. Mega-exhibitions in Gwangju, Fukuoka, Seoul, Busan, Taipei and Shanghai are all on the docket—not to mention the Yokohama Triennale, which is already up and running. In these days of biennial excess (not to mention the regular surfeit of art fairs, exhibitions openings and auctions), it is worth remembering that many of these international exhibitions were born of a genuine desire to address issues of importance in the cities that host them. Events such as Documenta, the Gwangju Biennale and Prospect New Orleans have each, over the years and in specific ways, demonstrated how cultural interventions can have a beneficial impact on their surroundings. As we approach this round of intense engagements, the September/October issue of ArtAsiaPacific concentrates on artists who create projects directly informed by local conditions. </p><p>We begin with the interdisciplinary practice of Akram Zaatari, whose work encompasses filmmaking, research, photography and curating. AAP editor at large HG Masters ruminates on some of the Beirut-based artist’s earliest photography as a teenager during the Lebanese Civil War and his co-founding of the Arab Image Foundation, as well as his acclaimed projects exploring personal narratives embedded within Lebanese history, including the Israeli invasion of 1982. On Zaatari’s two-decade-long career, Masters writes, “His voyages have been ones of the intellect, yet equally of the heart: for love and desire—lost amid, or surviving despite, warfare—is Zaatari’s greater theme.” </p><p>From Delhi, contributing editor Jyoti Dhar revisits the work of the late Rummana Hussain (1952–99). Trained as a painter, Hussain’s attention shifted to performance and installation as a response to the right-wing religious fundamentalism of the 1990s. Dhar discusses Hussain’s legacy, the political climate of the period in which she worked, and the influence she has had on the generation of artists and curators working on the Subcontinent today.</p><p>In a similar vein, independent curator Susan Gibb delves into the work of another artist challenging accepted ideologies born of nationalist sentiment, Seoul-based Minouk Lim. Like Hussain, Lim studied painting, but encountered limitations in the medium and sought alternative forms of art-making—often participatory in nature—to engage with the historical and economic realities of South Korea. In September, Lim will debut Navigation ID, perhaps her most ambitious project, which will involve transporting a shipping container holding the skeletal remains of civilian victims from little-known massacres during the Korean War to the Gwangju Biennale. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, managing editor John Jervis sits down with offbeat conceptualist Kwan Sheung Chi, who explains his interest in pursuing collective, community-focused endeavors, and his experience of working in an atmosphere burdened with its own particular set of socioeconomic barriers. Kwan’s participatory work To Defend the Core Values Is the Core of the Core Values, made with his wife Wong Wai Yin, for M+ museum’s “Mobile M+: Yau Ma Tei” exhibition in 2012, graces our cover. </p><p>Rounding out the Features, our special column Inside Burger Collection explores performative practices, real-time activities and script works as artistic methods through the work of Titus Kaphar, Wong Wai Yim, Lau Ching Ping, Choi Yan-Chi, Florian Germann, Vittorio Santoro and Fiona Banner. </p><p>Our Profiles include a visit to the home of Sydney’s Andrew and Cathy Cameron, known for their unwavering support of Australian artists and institutions, and a survey of the itinerant career of Adelaide-based artist Hossein Valamanesh, lauded for his sparse sculptural installations. We also meet the peripatetic Qatari-American artist Sophia al-Maria, who first achieved renown for her idiosyncratic project The Gaze of Sci-Fi Wahabi, and, from Beijing, “post-happy” artist Chen Zhou—both are currently embarking, or trying to embark, on feature-length films.</p><p>In Essays, contributing editor Michael Young considers whether Australia’s commercial galleries are experiencing a crisis, and if this is indicative of systemic failings in its art market, while Taipei desk editor David Frazier reassesses the career of Xu Bing, grappling with his ability to be many things to many people, both at home in China and abroad.  </p><p>For Where I Work, we visit the psychedelic studio of Zürich-based Tibetan artist Kesang Lamdark, known for his neo-tantric forms, often composed of plastics or aluminum cans. In One on One, Aboriginal artist Tony Albert reminisces about the late Gordon Bennett, whose paintings addressed the cycle of racism in Australia, and explains the impact Bennett’s work had on his own worldview as a young artist. Jenny F. So—scholar and director of the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s art museum—argues in The Point that budding art historians pursuing PhDs still face bleak career options, despite Hong Kong’s ambition to be Asia’s cultural entrepôt. Guest contributor Stefan Tarnowski files his Dispatch from Beirut, offering insights into the almost miraculous tenacity of the city’s art scene, which established itself from the ground up following 15 years of civil war, and questioning the effect the recent influx of Syrian artists might have on this tight-knit community. </p><p>This inevitable tension, between residents and recent arrivals, between the embedded and the wandering, lies at the heart of the global art world and the phenomenon of the international biennial. The numerous interactions—constructive and critical—that result are why these exhibitions remain crucial for artists as opportunities to make and share works that consider our society, past and present, and what it might be like tomorrow.</p>"

    title: "Tony Albert on Gordon Bennett", 
    content: "<p>TONY ALBERT ON GORDON BENNETT</p><p>REPORTS: ONE ON ONE BY TONY ALBERT FROM SEP/OCT 2014</p><p>AUSTRALIA</p><p>1999 was my last year at high school and the year I went to see “History and Memory in the Art of Gordon Bennett” at Brisbane City Gallery. It was the first exhibition I had ever attended and it changed my life forever. My sister and I were the only Aboriginal kids at our school and, beyond my family, there were very few “black” role models that I was aware of at the time. Seeing Gordon’s paintings opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. I realized for the first time that there was a way to articulate the feelings I had about myself and to understand my life story. I no longer felt alone. I left the exhibition overwhelmed with joy. </p><p>After high school I enrolled at the Queensland College of Art, where Gordon had gained his degree over ten years earlier. I was not the only artist inspired by Gordon to go to art school, and I know that many other black and white Australians are continuing to venture into careers in art and art history because of his powerful work. Through the Brisbane art community, I had the pleasure of meeting Gordon on several occasions, although I did not know him well. He was a quiet man, and preferred to stay away from the public eye. He rarely went to openings or engaged in the social aspects of the industry. Rather, he communicated to us through his art, and it was his art that spoke volumes. </p><p>Gordon was a real pioneer and set a precedent for political art in Australia. He spoke with an Aboriginal voice that could be universally understood—something that became more and more evident as his career grew and he started to be featured in increasing numbers of international biennials and exhibitions.</p><p>One of the things I most admired about Gordon was his incredible skill as a painter. He had the innate ability to work the canvas with great confidence. Every time I encounter one of his paintings in the flesh, my eyes dart across the surface, absorbing all the imagery, color and texture before me. His works always appear uninhibited and bold, like those of an old master. </p><p>Gordon unexpectedly and very sadly passed away on June 3 this year. A mutual friend, the curator Simon Wright, called me a few days later to let me know. It was an emotional call. Simon also wanted me to know that he and Gordon had been at lunch just the week before and had discussed my most recent letter. In 2010, I began writing letters to Gordon, inspired in part by his own letters written to Jean-Michel Basquiat. I was jolted one morning after opening the local newspaper to find an article about a prominent football coach who had used the term “black cunt” in reference to an Aboriginal player. As I read the article, Gordon’s early painting Daddy’s Little Girl II (1994) came vividly to mind. I thought of how the father in this artwork sits on his lounge chair in the corner of the living room relaxing with a smoker’s pipe in hand. Wearing a pretty Sunday dress, his blonde daughter plays with toy blocks spelling out the words “ABO,” “BOONG,” “COON” and “DARKIE,” all derogatory names regularly used against Aboriginal people. The girl points the blocks toward her father to gain his approval, love and attention. It is a small but incredibly powerful work in which Gordon brilliantly illustrates the cycle of racism, handed down and taught from one generation to the next. </p><p>In my last letter to Gordon, which is also included in my artwork for the 2014 Basil Sellers Art Prize, I said:</p><p>I wanted to write to you today to thank you for instilling in me a strong sense of pride. Despite the challenges I face as a Blak [sic] man, I will never give up on the fight against racism. There are so many heroes who stand up for our people, and it is those heroes—people like you—who inspire me to carry on. </p><p></p><p>I am so happy that Gordon received my letter. I really hope that he understood what an incredible man and mentor he was. I am incredibly indebted to his work, as are so many others. He is my hero. His vision, courage and talent will never be forgotten. Lest We Forget. </p>"
